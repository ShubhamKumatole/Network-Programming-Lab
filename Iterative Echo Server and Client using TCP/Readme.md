### Iterative client and server communication

- [This](https://github.com/ShubhamKumatole/Network-Programming-Lab/blob/main/Iterative%20Echo%20Server%20and%20Client%20using%20TCP/echoServer.c) is a iterative echo server 
- Though [client](https://github.com/ShubhamKumatole/Network-Programming-Lab/blob/main/Iterative%20Echo%20Server%20and%20Client%20using%20TCP/echoClient.c) communicates the same way with all the TCP servers Only when multiple clients try to communicate with the server 
  the difference between iterative and concurrent becomes prominent.
